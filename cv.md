#### About me 

Behind me, I have 8 years of medical education and several years of experience as a pediatric nephrologist, but now I am on the path of learning programming. I've been involved in programming for a relatively short time (less than 1 year), but with a strong sense of responsibility. In the spring of 2023, I completed the Frontend.React course from Yandex. After completing the course, I developed several small projects of my own. I am constantly learning, watching relevant webinars and lectures. I study algorithms and solve tasks on CodeWars. I dedicate 6-8 hours every day to learning and working on my pet project. I strive not to stand still and deepen my knowledge daily.
